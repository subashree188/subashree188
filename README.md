<h1 align="center">Hi, This is Suba Shree 🙋🏽</h1>
<b>I am a dedicated and versatile computer science engineer currently pursuing my MS in Computer Science at Indiana University Bloomington, driven by a passion for crafting efficient and scalable applications that deliver exceptional value. Prior to my academic journey, I gained two years of industry experience as a software engineer where I honed my ability to transform complex challenges into elegant solutions. I hold a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering from Anna University, India, where I built a robust foundation in algorithms, data structures, and machine learning. I am a firm believer in the power of hands-on projects to bridge theory and practice, thriving on practical experience to deepen my understanding. Throughout my journey, I have explored various facets of computer science - including UI design, backend development, database management, machine learning, and data analytics - because why limit myself to just one area of expertise when I can collect them all like Pokémon?<b>
